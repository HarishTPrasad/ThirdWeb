# Blockchain Crowdfunding Backend

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform backend built on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing Solidity smart contracts. The project leverages **thirdweb** to streamline the development process and deploy a secure and scalable solution for managing crowdfunding campaigns.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity, smart contracts handle the core functionalities of the crowdfunding system.
- **Scalable Backend**: Focuses purely on the backend logic, enabling seamless integration with any frontend or DApp.

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity**: For writing and deploying smart contracts.
- **thirdweb**: Used to simplify the blockchain setup, manage contract deployment, and handle Web3 interactions.
- **Ethereum**: Chosen blockchain for smart contract deployment.
- **Node.js/Express** (optional): To create an API layer for interacting with the blockchain backend (if applicable).

## How It Works
1. **Create a Campaign**: Users can create a new crowdfunding campaign by specifying a goal and deadline.
2. **Contribute**: Other users can contribute to any campaign by sending funds via Ethereum transactions.
3. **Withdraw Funds**: Once the funding goal is reached, the campaign creator can withdraw the funds.
4. **Refunds**: If the goal is not met within the specified deadline, contributors can claim a refund.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/HarishTPrasad/ThirdWeb.git
